But what more important tree, than our family tree? ❤️ \uD83D\uDC68\u200D\uD83D\uDC69\u200D\uD83D\uDC67\u200D\uD83D\uDC66 ❤️\n\nFor this weekend assignment, you will have to build a tree that has multiple children. It will have a few methods:\n\n`familySize`: Returns this size of **this parent and their children.**\n\n`findMember`: Given a `name`, it will return the `node` where that member exists. Otherwise, returns undefined.\n\n`log`: Logs out a specific structure (exampled below) of the family from this point down.\n\n`insert`: Inserts a child at this node.\n <hr />\n\n I've been kind enough to have written a suite of tests to help you get there. **But I am ok with you doing this outside of this repo, on your own, as long as the work you turn in on Monday can operate like the example below.**\n\n```javascript 1.8\nconst szwajkowskis = new FamilyTree('Pops');\n\nszwajkowskis.insert('Mike');\nszwajkowskis.insert('Amy');\nszwajkowskis.insert('Todd');\n\nconst mikesFamily = szwajkowskis.findMember('Mike');\n\nmikesFamily.insert('Eliot');\nmikesFamily.insert('Elise');\nmikesFamily.insert('Cas');\nmikesFamily.insert('George');\nmikesFamily.insert('Lear');\n\nconst amysFamily = szwajkowskis.findMember('Amy');\n\namysFamily.insert('Henry');\namysFamily.insert('Vivian');\n\nconst log = szwajkowskis.log();\nconsole.log(log);\n\n// Logs:\n/*\n-- Pops\n---- Mike\n------ Eliot\n------ Elise\n------ Cas\n------ George\n------ Lear\n---- Amy\n------ Henry\n------ Vivian\n---- Todd\n*/\n```\n<hr />\n\n### Using This Repo\n\nTo use this repo, the following instructions should be followed.\n\n1. Pull down this repo from github.\n2. At the root level of this repo, run `npm i` to install all dependencies.\n3. Write code in the adjacaent file `family-tree.js`.\n4. While writing that code, you can at any time run `npm run test` to see results of how you are doing against the tests in the terminal. If you want to see **live results** of how your code is doing, you can run `npm run test-watch`\n5. When passing all tests, if you know how - make a Pull Request against this GitHub repo. If you don't know how, you can simply slack us wherever you are keeping the code (but dont slack us the code itself!)"
